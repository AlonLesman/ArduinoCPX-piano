# Blynk App - The lazy parent
The app is mainly designed for parents who want to keep an eye on their kids from a distance and wake them up in the morning with a nice song. Parents can choose between two songs, "Take On Me" and "The Lion Sleeps Tonight," as wake-up calls. They can also access real-time data about their child's room, including the light level, temperature, and sound level, which is constantly updated and displayed in the app. Additionally, parents have the option to use the CPX board to light up their child's room with a colorful rainbow display as a pleasant surprise to wake them up. 

### The inputs include:

Temperature Sensor: The app collects temperature data from the child's room, allowing parents to ensure their child's comfort throughout the night.

Light Sensor: The light level in the room is measured using a sensor, providing parents with insights into the ambient lighting conditions.

Voice Sensor: By utilizing a voice sensor, the app can detect and analyze sounds in the child's room, helping parents monitor their child's activities or detect any unusual noises.

In addition to the input data, the application also receives messages from the server, which may include important notifications, updates, or instructions for the parents.

### The outputs include:

Speaker: The chosen wake-up call songs, such as "Take On Me" or "The Lion Sleeps Tonight," are played through a speaker connected to the app, gently waking the child up with soothing music.

LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes): Parents can use the app to activate the CPX board's LEDs, creating a visually appealing display of rainbow colors in the child's room. This feature adds an element of surprise and joy to the child's morning routine.
