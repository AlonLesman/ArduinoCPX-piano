# Blynk App - The lazy parent
  The app is designed mostly for parents who want to monitor their kids from far and 
  wake them up with with a nice song in the morning. 
  The parent has a collection of 2 wake up call songs - "take on me" and "the lion sleeps tonight".
  They also have access to data about the room in which their child is sleeping in - light level, temperature and sound level for monitoring their child.
  This data is displayed in the app and is constantly being updated. 
  Moreover to wake up their child they can light up their room using the cpx by
  displaying a rainbow of colors on the board. This is a feature that many kids like and see it as a morning surprise.
