Demonstrates a musical instrument that plays from a cup using 
hand movements, light exposure and touch. The playing is done using the Mozzi libarary
and 3 different oscilators, which together result in a tool that plays different sounds 
depending on the movement of the player's hands towards the cup and touch. 

The instrument uses 3 inputs: 
1. light sensor - the value read from the analog input is mapped
to a range that is used in the 3rd oscilator 
2. Capacitance sensor - Input pin A5 is used to read input and 
use value to set frequency for the carrier oscilator 
3. The output is the speaker on the board which is attached to an amplifier
