## implementation of Arduino CPX piano,
the simple piano use two inputs, the first one is the touch sensor which abvioustly stands for the piano keys.
the switch button stands for the piano tone level settings.
the outputs are the LEDs, and of course the speaker.
the result is nice and simple piano :)
